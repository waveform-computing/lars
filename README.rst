lars
====

lars is a small `Python`_ framework for working with httpd logs (from a variety
of common servers like `Apache`_, `nginx`_, and IIS). The primary purpose is to
provide a set of conversions to ease loading such logs into relational
databases, but numerous other possiblities can be realized with a little
imagination.

The project is written in `Python`_ and is open-sourced under the MIT license.
The `source code`_ can be obtained from GitHub. The `documentation`_ can be
read on ReadTheDocs.
