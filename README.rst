lars
====


lars is a small `Python`_ framework for working with httpd logs (from a variety
of common servers like `Apache`_, `nginx`_, and IIS). The primary purpose is to
provide a set of conversions to ease loading such logs into relational
databases, but numerous other possibilities can be realized with a little
imagination. Which is to say: lars is *not* a web log analyzer. However, it
*is* a toolkit that makes it quite easy to construct your own analyzer.
